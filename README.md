## Homebrew rules

There are 3 alignments/teams: good, evil and fated, and 3 character types:
- [Peacebrokers](#Peacebroker) start good.
- [Vile](#Vile) start evil.
- [Fatebound](#Fatebound) start fated.

Good team wins when all evils die. 

Evil team wins when all fated die. 

Fated team wins when all good die.

Team that wins | Team that died out
-|-
Good|Evil
Evil|Fated
Fated|Good

Game immediately ends when all players in any of the teams are dead.

### Setup
Players | Peacebroker | Fatebound | Vile
-|-|-|-
5|2|2|1
6|2|2|2
7|3|2|2
8|3|3|2
9|3|3|3
10|4|3|3
11|4|4<sup>\[\*\]</sup>|4<sup>\[\*\]</sup>

<sup>\[\*\]</sup>
Because [Sleepwalker](#Sleepwalker) must be in the game, put in all character tokens except the Sleepwalker in the bag, and then assign the "Sleepwalker" reminder token to a Vile or a Fatebound player.
