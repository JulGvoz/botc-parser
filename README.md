## Homebrew rules

There are 3 alignments/teams: good, evil and fated, and 3 character types:
- [Peacebrokers](#Peacebroker) start good.
- [Vile](#Vile) start evil.
- [Fatebound](#Fatebound) start fated.

Good team wins when all evils die. 

Evil team wins when all fated die. 

Fated team wins when all good die.

Team that wins | Team that died out
-|-
Good|Evil
Evil|Fated
Fated|Good

Game immediately ends when all players in any of the teams are dead.

### Setup
Players | Peacebroker | Fatebound | Vile
-|-|-|-
5|2|2|1
6|2|2|2
7|3|2|2
8|3|3|2
9|3|3|3
10|4|3|3
11|4|4<sup>\[\*\]</sup>|4<sup>\[\*\]</sup>

<sup>\[\*\]</sup>
Because Sleepwalker must be in the game, put in all character tokens except the Sleepwalker in the bag, and then assign the "Sleepwalker" reminder token to a Vile or a Fatebound player.


### Night order
|First night|Other nights|
|-|-|
|Weaver|Zenith|
|Seeker|Wanton|
|Neolith|Neolith|
||Cutthroat|
||Savage|
||Seeker|
||Apostle|

## Zenith

"Each night\*, choose any number of players: if they are on the same team, they cannot die tonight."

Zenith can protect players of the same alignment.

 - Zenith does not care about character type, only on alignment.
 - If a character states that someone dies tonight, players protected by Zenith cannot die from that character.
 - If a character states that someone dies tonight and all viable characters are protected by Zenith, nobody can die (this situation doesn't arrive in practice, as there are always at least 2 players not protected).
 - Zenith may any number of players: 0 players (choosing not to act), 1 player (can pick themselves or someone else), 2 players or more players (can include or exclude themselves).
 - Zenith can choose dead players.

### Examples
Zenith chooses themselves. [Cutthroat](#Cutthroat) targets them, but Zenith does not die.

Zenith was marked by [Neolith](#Neolith) the previous night, and another marked player died today. Zenith chooses themselves and [Calamity](#Calamity), but [Calamity](#Calamity) is killed by the [Savage](#Savage).

Zenith chooses the [Apostle](#Apostle) and [Cutthroat](#Cutthroat). Neither of them are protected, because they are on different teams. The [Neolith](#Neolith)'s ability kills the [Apostle](#Apostle).

Zenith chooses the Weaver tonight. Cutthroat tries to kill the Weaver, but Weaver survives.

Zenith chose themselves tonight. The next day, Calamity is executed. Zenith is killed by Calamity's ability.
