## Homebrew rules

There are 3 alignments/teams: good, evil and fated, and 3 character types:
- [Peacebrokers](#Peacebroker) start good.
- [Vile](#Vile) start evil.
- [Fatebound](#Fatebound) start fated.

Good team wins when all evils die. 

Evil team wins when all fated die. 

Fated team wins when all good die.

Team that wins | Team that died out
-|-
Good|Evil
Evil|Fated
Fated|Good

Game immediately ends when all players in any of the teams are dead.

### Setup
Players | Peacebroker | Fatebound | Vile
-|-|-|-
5|2|2|1
6|2|2|2
7|3|2|2
8|3|3|2
9|3|3|3
10|4|3|3
11|4|4<sup>\[\*\]</sup>|4<sup>\[\*\]</sup>

<sup>\[\*\]</sup>
Because Sleepwalker must be in the game, put in all character tokens except the Sleepwalker in the bag, and then assign the "Sleepwalker" reminder token to a Vile or a Fatebound player.

# Peacebroker

## Zenith

"Each night\*, choose any number of players: if they are on the same team, they cannot die tonight."

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulGvoz/twisted-fates/master/original-icons/zenith.png" alt="Zenith icon" width="100">

Zenith can protect players of the same alignment.

 - Zenith does not care about character type, only on alignment.
 - If a character states that someone dies tonight, players protected by Zenith cannot die from that character.
 - If a character states that someone dies tonight and all viable characters are protected by Zenith, nobody can die (this situation doesn't arrive in practice, as there are always at least 2 players not protected).
 - Zenith may any number of players: 0 players (choosing not to act), 1 player (can pick themselves or someone else), 2 players or more players (can include or exclude themselves).
 - Zenith can choose dead players.

### Examples
[Zenith](#Zenith) chooses themselves. [Cutthroat](#Cutthroat) targets them, but [Zenith](#Zenith) does not die.

[Zenith](#Zenith) was marked by [Neolith](#Neolith) the previous night, and another marked player died today. [Zenith](#Zenith) chooses themselves and [Calamity](#Calamity), but [Calamity](#Calamity) is killed by the [Savage](#Savage).

[Zenith](#Zenith) chooses the [Apostle](#Apostle) and [Cutthroat](#Cutthroat). Neither of them are protected, because they are on different teams. The [Neolith](#Neolith)'s ability kills the [Apostle](#Apostle).

[Zenith](#Zenith) chooses the [Weaver](#Weaver) tonight. [Cutthroat](#Cutthroat) tries to kill the [Weaver](#Weaver), but [Weaver](#Weaver) survives.

[Zenith](#Zenith) chose themselves tonight. The next day, [Calamity](#Calamity) is executed. [Zenith](#Zenith) is killed by [Calamity](#Calamity)'s ability.

## Calamity

"The 1st time you are executed (not the 1st day), all living players die & all dead players come back to life. You stay dead."
